# Sephora-Award-winning-product-prediction
Final Project for IEOR4523 - Data Analytics

Sephora is the largest cosmetics retailer in the U.S., with more than 6,000 products on sale. As the holiday season approaching, we are interested in finding out ideal products among the enormous amounts of total products. We referred to the Allure Best of Beauty Awards, which nominates the most amazing products in each category(e.g. Makeup, Skincare, Bath & Body) annually by the editors of Allure magazine. We wanted to examine the differences between allure and non-allure products’ attributes and use the dataset of both allure and non-allure products to find out potential award-winning products. In particular, we used the model we built to predict men’s potential allure products, as Allure doesn’t provide Man’s Beauty list currently. We believe that our results will be helpful for those who need advice on selecting the right men’s product.<br>

Techniques include: Web Scrapping, Text Mining, Data Visualization, Machine Learning and Neural Networks.
